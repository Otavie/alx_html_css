# Advanced CSS Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a continuation of the **HTML, advanced** project and focuses entirely on styling a webpage using **CSS**. The goal is to recreate a detailed web design using clean and structured CSS, based on a Figma design file.

You’ll work on various sections including the header, banner, quotes, video list, membership, FAQ, and footer — each of which has its own design details in Figma.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a styled HTML page based on a Figma design.
- Implement a well-structured CSS file (`styles.css`).
- Import custom fonts and use downloaded images appropriately.
- Maintain accurate design fidelity (fonts, colors, dimensions, spacing, etc.).
- Ensure semantic and accessible HTML structure.

## 🖼️ Figma Design File

Access the full design here: [🔗 Figma Page (Duplicate to Your Drafts)](https://www.figma.com/) _(Exact link to be provided)_

> **Note:**
>
> - If your system doesn't have the required fonts, download them:
>   - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
>   - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle-ot)
> - Some spacing and size values in Figma are in float (e.g. 13.4px) — rounding is acceptable.
